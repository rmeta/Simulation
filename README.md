# Homework Explanations

## Homework 1
This homework focuses on generating random numbers using a linear congruential generator (LCG). The function `unirand()` creates an empty vector and populates it with pseudo-random numbers based on a seed value, modulus, and multiplier. This method is foundational in random number generation for simulations and statistical computations.

## Homework 2
This homework is similar to HW1, also working with random number generation. It uses the same `unirand()` function to demonstrate the use of the linear congruential generator (LCG), which is a simple algorithm to produce sequences of pseudo-random numbers.

## Homework 4
This homework delves into simulations using binomial distributions. The function `rbinom()` simulates random variables, and the results are used to calculate probabilities of specific events, such as whether the number of successes is less than or equal to 5. This work demonstrates basic probability calculations and simulations.

## Homework 5
This homework covers random variable generation using the inverse transform method. The function `rmyV()` generates random variables following a particular distribution, and quantile calculations are performed to analyze the distribution's characteristics.

## Homework 6
This homework implements rejection sampling, a method used to generate samples from a desired distribution (in this case, a sine distribution). The function `rsin()` is used to generate random values and accept samples based on specific criteria. This technique is useful in cases where direct sampling from a distribution is not feasible.

## Homework 7
This homework involves simulating data for linear regression analysis. Random data is generated, and the function creates a data frame to perform linear modeling. It helps understand the fundamentals of linear regression and data simulation.
